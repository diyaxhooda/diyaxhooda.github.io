      <h1>George Burroughs</h1>
      <h2>Accused by: Several afflicted girls</h2>

      <h3>
        Burroughs had been the minister of Salem Village in the 1680s, but left under tense circumstances, including disputes over unpaid salary. Some families resented him—especially the powerful Putnam family, who played a major role in the trials.

      </blockquote>

      <h3>
        Witnesses said he had superhuman strength—lifting heavy barrels alone—which some saw as supernatural.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        George recited the Lord’s Prayer perfectly before his execution—something thought impossible for a witch. But the crowd was told it was the devil tricking them.
