      <h1>Martha Corey</h1>
      <h2>Accused by: Ann Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, and others</h2>

      <h3>
        Martha was a devout church member who spoke out against the witch trials, calling the girls’ afflictions fake. For that, they turned on her—claiming her spirit was tormenting them in court.

      <blockquote class="quote">
        “When it's "Burn the bitch" they're shrieking <br>
        When the truth comes out, it's quiet”<br>
        — <em>Taylor Swift, "Cassandra"</em>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>
        Her arrest shocked the town: a respected Christian accused of witchcraft?
      </h3>

      <h3>
        When the afflicted girls faked being hurt in court, Martha Corey laughed, seeing through their act. Her disbelief was twisted into evidence:
        Only a witch would mock the suffering of the bewitched.
