      <h1>Sarah Osborne</h1>
      <h2>Accused by: Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, and others</h2>

      <h3>
        Sarah Osborne was a landowning widow who challenged social norms: she remarried a servant, skipped church, and fought for her late husband’s property—unusual and frowned upon for a woman.
      </h3>

      <blockquote class="quote">
        
        "I've pleaded, with the powers and their plans
        I tried to rewrite it but I can't
        It's the history, the history of man”<br>
        — <em>Maisie Peters, "The History of Man"</em>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>
        Sarah Osborne missed church services for several months because she was ill. This was considered a serious offense in the Puritan community
      </h3>

      <h3>
        Her story reflects how women who defied gender roles were seen as dangerous, even when their only crime was living differently.
