      <h1>Sarah Good</h1>
      <h2>Accused by: Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, and others</h2>

      <h3>
        Because she was poor and begged for food, Sarah's muttering was seen as casting curses. Her low status made her an easy scapegoat.

      <h3>
        Sarah was among the first accused in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. Pregnant when arrested, she gave birth in jail, but the child died. She was hanged on July 19, 1692.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        Her fate has become symbolic of how society punishes women who are poor, outspoken, or mentally unwell.
