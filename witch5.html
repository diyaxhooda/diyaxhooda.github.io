      <h1>The Dog</h1>
      <h2>Accused by: Unknown villagers</h2>

      <h3>
        The girls claimed that the dog was an evil familiar—a spirit or creature that served witches and helped them carry out their magic.
        According to Puritan beliefs, witches were believed to have familiars—animals or creatures that served them, often in the form of cats, dogs, or other pets.

      <h3>
        The dog's crime was that it was reportedly barking loudly at the afflicted girls during their fit-induced rants.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        The dog was executed as part of the witch hunt. The animal was hanged, and it became one of the most absurd casualties of the Salem Witch Trials.

      <p>The story of the dog accused during the Salem Witch Trials is not extensively documented in a dedicated Wikipedia articles
